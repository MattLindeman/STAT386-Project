# STAT386-Project

This project is all about college basketball! Here I have the code I used to collect and scrape data and to do some exploratory data analysis. I also have the dataset I created, the figures I generated, and the feedback I received as I worked on two blog posts describing the process and created a dashboard through Streamlit.

Here our the links to my blog and my Streamlit dashboard:
